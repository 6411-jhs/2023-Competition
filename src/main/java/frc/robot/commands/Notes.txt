Testing Roadmap
===============

   test > ybutton > 1
1. Make sure DPS is measuring properly (tilt robot without moving)
2. Tune mounting detection condition to create a measureable difference between on and off incline
3. Gather relative values of mounting DPS on and off the incline and use those for the thresholds
4. Keep tuning settings until work

   test > ybutton > 2
5. Test yAcc values to see if they become more negative/positive
   test > ybutton > 3
6. See if balance DPS is measuring correctly
7. Use balance DPS and yAcc information to program rest of balance and direction code

After this it would be good to let the rest of the team work on making the motors work etc.
