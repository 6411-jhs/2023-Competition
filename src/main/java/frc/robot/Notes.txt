Things to be tested:

- Gyroscope
- Motor controller braking for drive train
- Neo code
- Drive train encoder values (program to correlate to real distances)

Things to be tuned again:

- Gyroscope balancing code (probably)
- Falcon motor degree movement


Command Layout:

I think it a good command layout would be to only create commands if they utilize multiple subsystems to do something.
For example balancing the charge station would use the drivetrain subsystem. But it would use the gyroscope, along with
the drive train motors. It's not necessarile using multiple subsystems but it is using multiple pieces of hardware.

After that an "Auto" subsystem should be created that utilize these individual commands properly.

Things that might need to be changes:

- Having drive train speed changed dynamically per circumstances for commands
In basic terms, have the commands switch between auto drive train speed and teleop drive train speed easily
